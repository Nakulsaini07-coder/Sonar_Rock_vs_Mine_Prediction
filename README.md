# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to classify sonar signal returns as **rock** or **mine**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Using a labeled dataset of sonar signal frequencies, we aim to train a model that accurately distinguishes between rocks and mines, useful in naval/military sonar applications.

## ✅ Results
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: 83%
- Evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification report

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files
- `Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `data.csv`: The Dataset is already included in this repository for easy access.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Colab

## 📊 Future Improvements
- Try ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Add hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
